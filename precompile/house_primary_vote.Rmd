**auspol** includes two functions to interact with the preference distribution data:

- get_house_primary_vote()
- house_primary_vote_summary()
- house_primary_comparison_plot()
- house_primary_historic_plot()

## What is this?

If you are unfamiliar with the Australian electoral system and preferential voting, please look at this [explainer(https://www.aec.gov.au/learn/preferential-voting.html) before proceeding.

## Getting the data

*get_house_primary_vote()* is the basic function to retrieve primary vote data published by the AEC. Without any arguments, it will deliver all the results for all elections, but it comes with parameters to facilitate filtering.
For instance, to get the results for Brisbane for 2022:

```{r}
get_house_primary_vote(division="Brisbane",year=2022)
```

Both parameters can include more than one value, e.g.

```{r}
get_house_primary_vote(division="Brisbane",year=c(2019,2022))
```

```{r}
get_house_primary_vote(division=c("Brisbane","Perth"),year=c(2019,2022))
```

By default, the results are presented by polling place, with the possibility to aggregate them.

```{r}
get_house_primary_vote(division=c("Brisbane","Perth"),year=c(2019,2022),aggregation = TRUE)
```

```{r}
get_house_primary_vote(division=c("Brisbane","Perth"),year=c(2019,2022), polling_places = c("Yokine North"))
```

It is also possible to restrict the results to selected polling places



Additionally, it is possible to select one or more states instead of a group of divisions, e.g.:

```{r}
get_house_primary_vote(state=c("TAS"),year=c(2019,2022),aggregation = TRUE)
```

It is also possible to filter results by one or more parties:

```{r}
get_house_primary_vote(state=c("NT"),year=c(2019,2022),aggregation = TRUE, party_abb=c("ALP","CLP"))

```

*house_primary_vote_summary()* builds on the basic function and summarises data
.
```{r}
house_primary_vote_summary(division = "Brisbane", year=2022)
```

Using the previous filters,  it is possible to get ad-hoc summaries, for instance - all the ALP votes in Queensland in 2022, or the historic Liberal vote in Franklin.

```{r}

house_primary_vote_summary(state = "QLD", year=2022,parties="ALP")

```



```{r}
house_primary_vote_summary(division="Franklin",parties="LP")
```

## Plotting 

### Historic Trends

The first plotting convenience function in this package allows comparing the evolution of primary voting across time. This function relies on house_primary_summary and uses many of its options. Its first use is to represent party trends in one electorate:

```{r primvote1}
house_primary_historic_plot("Canberra")
```

As they can be many minor parties, it is sometimes useful just to focus on a number of parties. This function allows filtering by a number of parties or by filtering by the most voted in a certain year. In both cases, it is possible to consolidate others' votes.



```{r primvote2}
house_primary_historic_plot("Canberra", parties =3, 
                            parties_year = 2022, 
                            include_others = TRUE )

```

Finally, it is possible to aggregate party acronyms - sometimes the same party has changed named or registered differently

```{r primvote3}

house_primary_historic_plot(division="Brisbane",parties=5,
                            merge_parties = list(LNP=c("LNP","LNQ","LP"),
                                                 ON=c("HAN","ON"))) 

```

## Results for one election

This package also contains a convenience function to look at the primary vote results for one division. Lile the previous function, this also inherits many of the attributes of *get_house_primary_vote*.

```{r primvote4}
house_primary_comparison_plot(division = "Kooyong", year=2022,individualise_IND = TRUE)

```

The plots can also be displayed using bars, as shown below

```{r primvote5}
house_primary_comparison_plot(state="TAS",year=2022,parties=c("LP"),plot_format = "bar")
```
